##
##  Goal:   semi-automate system configuration of the desktop plugins
##
##  Use:    source sysconf-plugins
##
##          pluginsConf step-number-or-name
##
##  NB:     This script is expected to be sourced by the sysconf script:
##          it is not expected to be used standalone.
##
##  This script has one step for installing desktop plugins for XFCE.
##
##  At the time of its creation, they may have been an idea of regrouping the
##  installation of plugins for all application software here but that idea no
##  longer has any traction.
##
##  At the time of its creation, XFCE was only used on venerable machines and,
##  it seems, not all the required plug-ins were installed.
##
##  In principle, this steps ensures all the required plug-ins are installed
##  regardless of what the distribution installs by default.  In practice, the
##  names of the plug-ins may change between releases.
