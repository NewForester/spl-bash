#!/bin/bash --posix

##
##  Goal:   semi-automate system configuration
##
##  Use:    sysconf --flag | [--check] step
##
##  where:  step is either a number or a mnemonic
##
##  Flags:  steps   list steps and mnemonics in numeric order
##          log     list all the steps attempted so far
##          current list the current step (last attempted)
##          erase   erase the last (attempted) step from the log
##          next    list the next steps to be done
##          refresh reload the script from its reference
##          help    list instruction for use
##
##  Files:  ~/keep/sysconf - the log of the sysconf steps attempted
##
##  System configuration is broken down into a number of steps.
##  Each step is given a number:  the sequence of numbers is the suggested order in which the steps are done.
##  Not all steps are relevant for every installation.
##  Most steps are also given a mnemonic and that can be used instead of the number.
##
##  Note:   The first steps are bootstrap:  until they have been executed this script is not there to execute.
##          It is expected they will be cut and pasted into a ssh login console.
